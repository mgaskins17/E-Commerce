## Installation

If you choose to install, please clone the file then open the server.js file in integrated terminal then run "npm i" to install the dependencies. Then login into your mysql and run the schema file to establish a database you can use. Then go back to a normal powershell terminal and run the seeds file to populate the database. Then you can run "node server.js" to run the program.
